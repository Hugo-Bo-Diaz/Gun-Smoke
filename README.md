The game consist in overcome all the levels beating down as many enemies as you can and defeating the final boss to get the maximum points as possible. To accomplish that objective you have some power ups to help yo raise your punctuation and give you special stats.

Our team R.R.R. Pizza Mozzarela has created the first level of the game, with all the art redisigned. We hope you enjoy it!

Here it is a gameplay video in debug mode.
